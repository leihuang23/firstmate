# tmux runtime backend

tmux is Firstmate's verified reference runtime backend and the fully supported baseline for secondmate homes.
[`configuration.md`](configuration.md#runtime-backend-configbackend--fm_backend) owns shared backend selection and metadata semantics.

## Setup

Install tmux with `brew install tmux` or your platform package manager.
The universal harness and toolchain requirements are in [`configuration.md`](configuration.md#toolchain).

tmux is the hard default when no explicit setting or runtime auto-detection selects another backend.
Select it explicitly with local `config/backend` containing `tmux`, with `FM_BACKEND=tmux` for one launch, or by asking Firstmate to use tmux.
An explicit selection is also the opt-out from Herdr or cmux runtime auto-detection.

No provisioning is required before the first task.

## Watching the crew

For the best visible experience, launch the primary harness inside a tmux session:

```sh
tmux new -s firstmate
```

Crew tasks become windows in that session.
`tmux display-message -p '#S'` prints its name.
If the primary harness runs outside tmux, Firstmate creates or reuses a detached session named `firstmate`:

```sh
tmux attach -t firstmate
```

Each task window is named `fm-<id>`.

```sh
tmux list-windows -t <session-name>
tmux select-window -t <session-name>:fm-<id>
```

Typing into an attached task window is authoritative direct intervention.
Routine supervision does not require attachment: `bin/fm-peek.sh <id>` captures a bounded tail and `FM_HOME=<home> bin/fm-send.sh <id> '<text>'` steers the recorded endpoint.

Verify setup by spawning a small task and confirming its `fm-<id>` window appears in the selected session.

## Current behavior and safety

A target-existence check proves only that the pane exists.
The deeper tmux agent-liveness probe first verifies exact window membership, then reads `#{pane_current_command}` to distinguish a running harness process from a bare idle shell.
It classifies recognized Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, pi-signed, Grok, and Kimi process names as `alive`, common shells as `dead`, an authoritatively absent window as `missing`, unreadable state as `unreadable`, and every other process as `ambiguous`.
Only `dead` and `missing` authorize recovery because a false dead result could launch a duplicate agent.

The verified Pi Launcher path reports the exact foreground command `pi-launcher` for both pi and pi-signed, while direct executable identities `pi`, `pi-signed`, and `Pi` remain accepted exactly.
Similar or prefixed process names are not accepted through those exact Pi-family entries.
- The active agent-liveness limitations are described in [Current behavior and safety](#current-behavior-and-safety).
- The OpenCode busy-queue exception is tmux-specific; Herdr retains its separately documented gap.
